Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum 
to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed as modifying the License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or 
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the 
terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding 
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement

or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as 
deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable 
to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages 
of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure 
or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works 
thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting 
such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by 
reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions. 

  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked
Version&quot;.

  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version. 

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your 
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. 
(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General 
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do 
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you 
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to 
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, 
too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they 
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you 
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone 
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is 
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what 
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not 
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to 
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain 
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we 
have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or 
not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed 
by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 
General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, 
and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work 
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; 
they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the 
output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true 
depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish 
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your 
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed 
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But 
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, 
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise 
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based 
on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) 
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source 
code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form 
with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all 
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used 
to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, 
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed 
(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same 
place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled 
to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program 
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who 
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated 
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing 
else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These 
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing 
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works 
based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient 
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the 
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any 
other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as 
a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, 
the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right 
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting 
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. 
Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide 
if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the 
rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by 
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, 
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this 
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public 
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but 
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number 
of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the 
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution 
conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted 
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO 
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY 
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT 
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, 
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA 
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, 
you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.

1. Definitions
The terms &quot;reproduce,&quot; &quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;derivative works,&quot; 
and &quot;distribution&quot; have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

A &quot;contribution&quot; is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.

A &quot;contributor&quot; is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.

&quot;Licensed patents&quot; are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.

2. Grant of Rights
(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license 
conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, 
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare 
derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative 
works that you create.

(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions 
and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, 
import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works 
of the contribution in the software.

3. Conditions and Limitations
(A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' 
name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are 
infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software 
ends automatically.

(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.

(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only 
under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. 
If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only 
do so under a license that complies with this license.

(E) The software is licensed &quot;as-is.&quot; You bear the risk of using it. 
The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional 
consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted 
under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, 
fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
